# RSA-combined-approach

Re-implementation of the combined approach for CQ answering over RSA ontologies described in [[1](#references)].

> Please note that the prototype mentioned in [[1](#references)] is not available (and the contributors of this repository have never seen it); therefore, this "re-implementation" could be completely different from that prototype (potentially even in a different programming language).
