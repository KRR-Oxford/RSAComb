# Combined approach for RSA

Re-implementation of the combined approach for CQ answering over RSA ontologies described in [[1](#references)].

> Please note that the prototype mentioned in [[1](#references)] is not available (and the contributors of this repository have never seen it);
> therefore, this "re-implementation" could be completely different from that prototype (potentially using different tools and programming language).

## Preliminaries

In order to use this program you need to have [RDFox](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/product) available in your system, along with a valid license.
RDFox is proprietary software and as such we are not able to distribute it along with our code.
Please refer to [this link](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/tryrdfoxforfree) to request a free trial.

This software has been developed and tested with RDFox v.4.0

## Changes introduced

We tried to implement the system as close as possible to the theoretical description provided in [[1](#references)].
Regardless, we had to deal with the fact that we where using different tools to carry out reasoning tasks and we where probably using a different language to implement the system.
The following is a summary of fixes (ðŸ”§), changes (ðŸ”„) and improvements (âš¡), we introduced along the way:

+ ðŸ”§ FIX
